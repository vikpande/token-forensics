### What is a hosted service in Subgraph:

- The Hosted Service is a free Graph Node Indexer. Developers can deploy subgraphs indexing a range of networks, which will be indexed, and made available to query via graphQL. To improve the performance of the service for active subgraphs, the Hosted Service will archive subgraphs that are inactive.

#### Important Note:
A subgraph is defined as "inactive" if it was deployed to the Hosted Service more than 45 days ago, and if it has received 0 queries in the last 45 days.
